What Happened to Blockchain Gaming?
https://www.gamedesigning.org/gaming/blockchain/
I like classic style games like dog and cat 2d game, but these games are visually too crazy.
Checkout a blockchain game company

Most of the game channels have discord and it's possible to track game status and users' feedback there

# Reference games that might be good to build from scratch (It's not blockchain, it would be better to get idea from existing blockchainy games)
https://github.com/fuhrmanator/melee-sim-js
Check for game idea "The Fantasy Trip Melee"
Verified: This is game where 3 characters participate in game and players can do fight, move, escape etc. Winners get bonus points.

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143884/machi-koro
Machi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on their own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than their rivals. On their turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, they get the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your dice (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of their city on future turns. The first player to construct all of their landmarks wins!

# Games to build 
1. Build Warmax like game for easiest game prototype
http://wormax.io
It's a game that is derivated from a game called "slither".
Open sources to consider
https://github.com/iiegor/slither
https://github.com/crytic/slither
https://github.com/whxaxes/slither
https://github.com/Loonride/slither.io-clone
https://github.com/maxmx/slither
https://github.com/PlitherProject/Plither
https://github.com/dahquan/rattlesnake

Items and the users' score will be stored in Pylons system.
I will run socket.io server that connect users globally.

2. Build Cat vs Dog like game for another easier game
It's classic game, but there can be users who like to play.
Players can purchase Cat and Dogs and other great items.
And multiple players can do match online with their character.

*How to play Cat vs. Dog swf on MacOS*

Download [Elmedia player](https://mac.eltima.com/media-player.html) and install on MacOS.
Run the Elmedia player and drag and drop `catvsdog.swf`. That's all for how to run the game.

3. Build a first web based multi-player board game which is similar to stratego
http://www.stratego.com/
It's a game that is similar to what I have been playing when young on paper. (Elephant, Lion, Tiger, Rat etc.)
Open source to consider
https://github.com/benjaminkomen/stratego-frontend

Is it possible to implement this on Pylons system? Michael said it's not easy, consider doing it later when they support multiple players feature.

4. Build a "Legends of Andor" like game, a kind of board game
http://legendsofandor.com/
‚ÄúLegends of Andor‚Äù is a cooperative board game for 2‚Äì4 heroes.
The idea is defeating the Andor region.

Open source to consider
https://github.com/Saphareas/Andor-Custom-Cards-Builder

5. Build a casino game 

Open source to consider
Web client for blockchain poker: https://github.com/acebusters/acebusters-frontend

https://github.com/Yaoir/VideoPoker-Go
A text-based video poker game - Go (Golang) version
Verified: Text based poker will be easy to make

6. Build a Galaxy Game

https://planets.nu
Galaxy Game where gamers can attack other planets etc and a player can purchase items to attack other planets or defend his/her planets.
Cosmos is a universe and this game idea might be great.
There can be a rule to calculate distance between planets.
Idea for calculating distance between planets
This is sample address
cosmos1jh78j6lkla83uvukyd24s33wu83ug3e394h0d3
This can be converted to 3D axis point
(1jh78j6lkla83uv, ukyd24s33w, u83ug3e394h0d3)

It's hard to attack a planet which is far away
He can put safe items there
Like diamond or something
And to conquer other world, he needs to travel
And the travel time could take 1-2 days
If he left to attack other planet, that planet does not have enough power to defeat other attacks
If possible, there can be a barrack to generate soldiers
