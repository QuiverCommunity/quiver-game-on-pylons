# Build a first web based multi-player board game which is similar to stratego
http://www.stratego.com/
It's a game that is similar to what I have been playing when young on paper. (Elephant, Lion, Tiger, Rat etc.)
Open source to consider

Is it possible to implement this on Pylons system? Michael said it's not easy, consider doing it later when they support multiple players feature.
