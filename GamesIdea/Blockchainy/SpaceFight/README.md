Idea for calculating distance between planets
This is sample address

This can be converted to 3D axis point
(1jh78j6lkla83uv, ukyd24s33w, u83ug3e394h0d3)

# Basic Idea

It's hard to attack a planet which is far away
He can put safe items there
Like diamond or something
And to conquer other world, he needs to travel
And the travel time could take 1-2 days
If he left to attack other planet, that planet does not have enough power to defeat other attacks
If possible, there can be a barrack to generate soldiers

# Idea detail

This is real blockchainy game. That require understanding of blockchain.
